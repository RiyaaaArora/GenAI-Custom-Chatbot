Chatbot using TensorFlow and Keras
Introduction
This is a simple chatbot built using TensorFlow and Keras. The chatbot is trained on a dataset of intents and responses, and can respond to user input based on the intent identified.

Features
Trained on a dataset of 7 intents (greeting, goodbye, thanks, about, name, help, createaccount, complaint)
Uses TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the neural network model
Uses NLTK for tokenization and preprocessing of user input
Uses Colorama for adding color and style to terminal output
Saves and loads the trained model, tokenizer, and label encoder using Pickle
How to Use
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the chatbot using python chatbot.py
Interact with the chatbot by typing messages and observing the responses
Dataset
The dataset used to train the chatbot is stored in intents.json. The dataset consists of 7 intents, each with a list of patterns and responses.

Model Architecture
The chatbot uses a neural network model with the following architecture:

Embedding layer with 16 dimensions and 1000 vocabulary size
Global average pooling layer
Two dense layers with 16 units and ReLU activation
Output layer with softmax activation and 7 units (one for each intent)
Training
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss. The training data is padded to a maximum length of 20 tokens.

Saving and Loading
The trained model, tokenizer, and label encoder are saved using Pickle. The saved files can be loaded and used for future interactions.
